block.flar-expansion-diminutiveReconstructor.name = Subtractive Reconstructor
block.flar-expansion-diminutiveReconstructor.description = A necessary evil. Downgrades your Flare into a Flar.

# Alternate Healing Regiment Blocks
block.flar-expansion-attendant.name = Attendant
block.flar-expansion-attendant.description = Fires healing pellets that'll home to the aiming position. Curves and forms a pear-like trajectory. Dangerous when it's in large numbers.
block.flar-expansion-custodian.name = Custodian
block.flar-expansion-custodian.description = A slightly better version of the Meno, but it now shoots sweeps that don't deflect bullets. The sweeps harm most of the structures that come in its way.
block.flar-expansion-custodian.details = And who else inspired you to make it shoot big sweeps?
block.flar-expansion-curator.name = Curator
block.flar-expansion-curator.description = A flame turret that throws a really big covalency fire that'll heal mostly everything. It doesn't reload that well for its great destruction.
block.flar-expansion-overseer.name = Overseer
block.flar-expansion-overseer.description = A large turret that may show no mercy for your opponents, usually more powerful than himself.
block.flar-expansion-overseer.details = "But who cares, I'm the frickin' Overseer!"

# Units
unit.flar-expansion-flar.name = Flar
unit.flar-expansion-flar.description = A very tiny unit that's sillily rotating on your enemies. Looks rather weird.
unit.flar-expansion-flar.details = There are rumors of someone developing shield weakening mechanisms. And who else done that?
unit.flar-expansion-fler.name = Fler
unit.flar-expansion-fler.description = A small yet fast skirmisher that launches accelerating lasers that pierce on your enemies, which can't damage after they were initially shot. For some reason, you can heal with this unit. Huh? weird.
unit.flar-expansion-flir.name = Flir
unit.flar-expansion-flir.description = A formidable T3 opponent. Shoots rapid bolts that'll kill most weak structures though its "eye", which is in the center of the unit.
unit.flar-expansion-meno.name = Meno
unit.flar-expansion-meno.description = A minuscule unit with a shield to protect itself, bouncing bullets once they hit it, but the unit itself is brittle, and so does the shield. Acts as a defence for other units, builds and shoots electric arcs.
unit.flar-expansion-meno.details = Oh look, it's another one.
unit.flar-expansion-mino.name = Mino
unit.flar-expansion-mino.description = Shoots big moving lasers that incinerate everything else that touches it. Very dangerous, even though the lasers deal a very low amount of damage.
unit.flar-expansion-mino.details = It's another generic flying Vela unit. I have no excuses.
unit.flar-expansion-muno.name = Muno
unit.flar-expansion-muno.description = An unit slightly larger than the Flir. Extremely dangerous. Fires bombs that create a shimmering explosion on collision, at a consecutive rate, even surpassing Quad's reload speeds. Also fires homing pellets that destroy most light bullets.
unit.flar-expansion-muno.details = Yes, yes. I've put the Quad's bombs into another unit. Totally not that shameful at all.

flar-expansion-shield.description = Some personal notes from Antumbra himself:\n\nThe shield is a remarkable tool that allows you to protect yourself against multiple attacks.\nNote: the shield can be rotated by the user's desires, in a full circle range, without the need to rotate the unit itself. It rotates along the user's aim position.\n\nA shield's most known ability is to deflect bullets, but unfortunately, it consumes a huge amount of the shield's health. Another thing that's lesser known is the bullet exploding. Bullets that have a bigger/equal damage than the shield's maximum threshold will explode right in front of the user, disabling the shield for a moment.\nNote: certain bullets won't get deflected nor detonated by the shield, meaning they'll pass and hit the user.

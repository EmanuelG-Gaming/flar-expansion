# Unit Factories
block.flar-expansion-diminutiveReconstructor.name = Subtractive Reconstructor
block.flar-expansion-diminutiveReconstructor.description = A necessary evil. Downgrades your Flare into a Flar.

# Units
unit.flar-expansion-flar.name = Flar
unit.flar-expansion-flar.description = Seems to be an awkward moment to be shrinked down, but still keep the same amount of power, right? - Well, you can do that, which is the Flar.
unit.flar-expansion-fler.name = Fler
unit.flar-expansion-fler.description = A small yet fast skirmisher that launches accelerating lasers that pierce on your enemies, which can't damage after they were initially shot. For some reason, you can heal with this unit. Huh? weird.
unit.flar-expansion-flir.name = Flir
unit.flar-expansion-flir.description = A formidable T3 opponent. Shoots rapid bolts that guarantee an explosive death for most weak structures though its "eye", which is situated in the center of the unit.
unit.flar-expansion-meno.name = Meno
unit.flar-expansion-meno.description = A minuscule unit with a shield to protect itself. Bullets will get bounced once they hit the shield, but the unit itself is brittle. Acts as a defence for other units and can build.
unit.flar-expansion-meno.details = Oh look, it's another one.
unit.flar-expansion-mino.name = Mino
unit.flar-expansion-mino.description = Shoots big moving lasers that incinerate everything else that touches it. Very dangerous, even though the lasers deal a very low amount of damage.
unit.flar-expansion-mino.details = It's another generic flying Vela unit. I have no excuses.
unit.flar-expansion-muno.name = Muno
unit.flar-expansion-muno.description = An unit lightly bigger than the Flir. Extremely dangerous, firing bombs that create a shimmering explosion on collision at a consecutive rate, even surpassing Quad's reload speed. It's a close-range unit.
unit.flar-expansion-muno.details = Yes, yes. I've put the Quad's bombs into another unit. Totally not that shameful at all.
